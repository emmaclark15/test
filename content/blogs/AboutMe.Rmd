# Emma Clark

Welcome to my background page! My full name is Emma Christine Clark and I am from the United States of America. I was born in New York City where I lived for three years before I moved halfway across the country to Chicago for another four years. When I was seven years old my family moved to Huntington Beach, California where they still reside today. My best friends are my two little brothers, Michael and Jack, who are not so little anymore as you can see below. I love my family and hometown in California but always wanted to explore and see more. After I spent 10 years in my comfort bubble of Southern California, I broke out of it and moved 3000 kilometers away to the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, USA. There I earned a BBA in Accountancy and represented my University playing on the Varsity softball team. Although the winters were a bit different, I loved every minute of my four years at Notre Dame and would not change it for the world.

Being an athlete was a large part of my identity for as long as I could remember. It was a dream come true for me to represent my University and travel around the US playing softball for Notre Dame. The sum of my work and achievements as an athlete is highlighted [here.](https://und.com/roster/emma-clark-2/) Aside from athletics, I enjoy deep sea fishing, going to the beach, cooking, and of course travelling.

I chose to come to London because it is one of the largest and most diverse settings for international business. I hope to use this year to learn about people and cultures from every corner of the world and gain a new appreciation and understanding. As I searched for schools in London, it was an easy choice for the MAM program at LBS. LBS has the highest level of prestige and rigor while still fostering a community of support and compassion not only for but among its students. This rich environment will help me pursue my passion for data analytics in the healthcare industry. I cannot wait for the new challenges and experiences this year and my future have to offer!
