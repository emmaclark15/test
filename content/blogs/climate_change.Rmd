# Climate change and temperature anomalies

If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined
Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the
Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of
temperature anomalies can be found
here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base,
period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between
1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- read_csv(here::here("data","nasa.csv"),
                    skip=1,
                    na="***")


```

You have two objectives in this section:

1.  Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather`
    dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this
    assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

2.  Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use
    `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as
    `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as
    `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.

```{r tidyweather}

# drop unrelated columns
weather <- select(weather,c(1:13)) 

# convert to tidy dataset for convinence
tidyweather <- weather %>%  
  pivot_longer(c(2:13), names_to = "month", values_to = "delta")


```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for

1.  year,
2.  month, and
3.  delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trend
line. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date`
in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically.

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))


ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies",
    x= "Year",
    y="Temperature Deviation"
  )


```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months?
Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month,
again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels;
that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or
abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`.

The graph shows that in relatively cold months (Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb,
and Mar), the variation in temperature deviation is higher and the
slopes of the trend lines are steeper than other months, which indicates
that the effect of increasing temperature is more pronounced in those
months when compared to summer months such as June, July, and August.

```{r facet_wrap}

tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(month) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~month)+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (title = "Temperature Trends by Month",
        y="Temperature Deviation",
        x="Year")


```

It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to
study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as
1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculates a
temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of 1951-1980.
The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups
data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010
and 2011-present.

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the
`mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains
information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign
the different periods using `case_when()`.

```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))


```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the
`Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot
to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by
the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to
`interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot}


# use fill=interval to group and colour the data by different time periods
ggplot(comparison, aes(x = delta, fill = interval, alpha = 1)) +
  guides(alpha = FALSE) +
  geom_density() +
      theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Temperature Deviations by Time Periods",
    x="Temperature Deviations",
    y="Delta"
  )



```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might
be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using
`group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display
the result.

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta),na.rm=TRUE) 

#plotting the data:
average_annual_anomaly %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x=Year,y=mean_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")+
  
  #change theme to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs("Average Annual Temperature Anomalies",
       x="Year",
       y="Mean Temperature Deviation")


```
